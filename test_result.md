#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

While the multi-coin prices endpoint successfully returns enhanced signal data embedded in price responses, the dedicated signal generation endpoints are not producing signals. Root cause: The generate_advanced_signal function requires 65% strength threshold and may not be generating signals with current mock data. However, the WebSocket mock data generation IS working correctly and provides signals in the multi-coin endpoint. The issue is specifically with the individual signal endpoints, not the overall signal generation system."

Trading signal execution notifications work correctly with concise format for both BUY and SELL signals. WebSocket signal generation (when signals exist) uses proper concise format.

    message: "🎯 REVIEW REQUEST TESTING COMPLETED - ENABLE REAL TRADING ENDPOINT: Conducted focused testing of POST /api/binance/enable-real-trading endpoint as specifically requested. ✅ EXACT ERROR IDENTIFIED: When user clicks 'Enable Real Trading' button, they receive HTTP 200 response with JSON {'status': 'error', 'message': 'Binance client not available'}. ✅ GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS CONFIRMED: Despite proxy being enabled (gate.smartproxy.com:10000), Binance API access is still blocked. ✅ PROXY STATUS VERIFIED: GET /api/proxy/status shows enabled=true but binance_available=false, confirming proxy is not successfully routing Binance API calls. ❌ ROOT CAUSE: Demo proxy credentials are insufficient for actual Binance API routing to bypass geographical restrictions. ❌ USER EXPERIENCE: Frontend button click results in error message 'Binance client not available' being displayed to user. ❌ PROXY EFFECTIVENESS: The proxy configuration infrastructure works correctly, but the demo proxy service cannot actually route Binance API calls to bypass geo-restrictions. 💡 SOLUTION REQUIRED: Real working proxy service credentials needed to resolve geographical restrictions and enable Binance API access."
